## Step 1: Share a useful resource

_Deadline Monday_

All share a video or a resource (this can be a drawing, an article or a podcast) that was helpful for you the last few weeks with learning HTML/CSS. Please share this in the channel of your class in Slack. Also write as small note about what the resource is about and why you think it's so helpful (you can share more than one if you like).

## Step 2: Git homework

_Deadline Wednesday_

Git homework for this week:

Pair up with another student in your class. The homework requires two people to work together. Let's call them admin and user.

1. admin creates a new repository on github called **animals**.
2. admin adds a file called “zoo.txt” with some animals generally found in a zoo.
3. admin commits and pushes the changes (in master branch).
4. user forks the repository created by admin and bring it to their machine (covered during classwork).
5. user makes a new branch called user-dev.
6. user adds another file called “pets.txt” with some animals generally found in a home.
7. user commits and pushes his branch to remote.
8. user creates a pull request(PR) to merge changes from user's _user-dev_  branch to admin's _master_ branch.
9. admin reviews the pull request and approves and merges changes.
